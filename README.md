# Start9
Start9 is a *work in progress* extensible, customizable shell supplement for Windows, one which aims to be not only modular, but extends to many needs.

## Planned Modules
*We're planning to package Start9 with 14 modules built in, each module functioning like a familiar user interface.*:
### Start Menus / Screens
- Windows 8.1 (build 9600)  
- Windows 10 (build 9795)  
- Windows 10 (build 9879)  
- Windows 10 (build 9926)  
- Windows 10 (build 10240)  
- Windows 10 (build 14393)  
- Windows 10 (build 15063)  

### Taskbars
- Windows XP (3790)  
- windows Vista (6000)  
- Windows 7 (7601)  

### Misc.
- macOS Dock
- Windows Longhorn (build 4074) Sidebar  
- Windows 10 (build 9888) Notification Center  
- Windows 10 (build 10240) Notification Center  

*As Start9 is still in the early stages of development, compatibility isn't a big concern right now*
